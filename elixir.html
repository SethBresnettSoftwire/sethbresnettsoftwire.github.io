# Elixir

---

# What is Elixir?

* Functional
* Dynamic typing
* Ruby-like syntax
* Built on top of Erlang

???

*Functional - ie immutable data structures, first class functions.
*Typing and syntax mean it's fairly lightweight.
*Similar to Scala and Java

---

# What is Erlang?

* Built in the 90s for telecommunications
* Focused on lightweight processes passing messages
* High reliability
* But a bit old-fashioned

???

* Built by Ericsson
* Runs on a VM - like Java
* Similar philosophy to akka
* Philosophy based around supervision trees, hot patching, very reliable
* Some syntax, standard library a bit weird

---

# Enter Elixir

* Created in 2011
* Syntax
* Tooling
* Polymorphism, macros

---

# Why use it?

* Concurrency, reliability
* Horizontal scaling
* Web server, message bus etc

???

* Not best choice for number-crunching etc
* Scale horizontally with lots of small processes

# Code sample time!

# Functions

```elixir
defmodule MyList do
  def len([]), do: 0
  def len([head|tail]), do 1 + len(tail)
end
```

???

* We're using pattern matching, but multiple definitions rather than top-level match
* Quite nice because it reduces nesting

---

# Pipe operator

```elixir
people = DB.find_customers
orders = Orders.for_customers(people)
tax = sales_tax(orders, 2016)
filing = prepare_filing(tax)
```

```elixir
filing = DB.find_customers
          |> Orders.for_customers
          |> sales_tax(2016)
          |> prepare_filing
```

???

* This fits in well with the functional idiom of functions operating on data

---

# Maps and pattern matching

```elixir
defmodule Barrier do
  car = %{ name: "Land Rover", height: 1.72 }
  person = %{ name: "Shaquille", height: 2.16 }

  def check_height(%{ height: height, name: name }) do
    IO.puts "Checking height for #{name}"
    height <= 1.9
  end

  def check_height(other) do
   # Handle missing attributes here
  end
end
```

???

* Maps like ruby hashes
* Allowing you to cut out a lot of ifs
* Generally lots of nice functionality around pattern matching
* Means it's easy to write functions which inspect the input then do something based on it

---

# Binaries

```elixir
b = << 1, 2, 4 >> # = 01 02 04 (hex)
b = << 1::size(2), 1::size(3) >> # = 01 001 (binary)

def process(<< length::unsigned-integer-size(8), 
               flags::bitstring-size(4), 
               data::binary >>) do
 options = read_flags(flags)
 process_data(data, options)
end
```

???

* Very useful for handling custom message protocols etc - cuts out a lot of boilerplate code
* Again shows that pattern matching is central to how things work
